The Autonomous Vehicle Offensive and Defensive Framework (AV-ODF) provides a structured, research-driven view of cyber threats and mitigations for autonomous vehicles. 
It unifies offensive techniques adapted from MITRE ATT&CK with defence strategies derived from NIST 800-160, NIST CREF, and automotive security literature.
AV-ODF is designed to help researchers, engineers, and practitioners analyse attack surfaces, trace attack paths, and identify suitable countermeasures for safety-critical vehicle systems.

The framework includes a curated set of AV-specific tactics and techniques, detailed mitigation records, and references from academic studies, industry reports, and real-world vehicle incidents. 
Its goal is to provide an accessible, extendable knowledge base that supports modelling, simulation, risk assessment, and the development of resilient vehicle architectures.
